    "# Chapter 11: QUATERNIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "Quaternions were invented by Sir William Rowan Hamilton around 1843 and were considered a breakthrough.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In subsequent chapters Willard Gibbs and Oliver Heaviside came up with a vector concept that proved easier to use for many of the physics applications for which quaternions had originally been proposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "However quaternions and vectors together have become chief tools in accomplishing rotation.  Quaternions have some advantages over rotation matrices.  They're used a lot in physics engines, computer games, and robotics, whenever rotations are necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think of quaternions as \"vectors on steroids\" if that helps.  They have some properties in common with vectors, and are conceived to have a \"vector part\" somewhat like complex numbers have a \"real part\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit quaternions (w, x, y, z) with w\\*\\*2 + x\\*\\*2 + y\\*\\*2 + z\\*\\*2 == 1, form a group under multiplication.  Any two unit quaternions, when multiplied, produce a unit quaternion (Closure), and every unit quaternion has an inverse (w, -x, -y, -z), such that q \\* q\\*\\*-1 gives the unit quaternion (1, 0, 0, 0)."
