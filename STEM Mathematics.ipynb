A nuclear ball is surrounded by a layer of twelve, all touching it, and adjacent neighbors.  The shape so formed is not a cube, but a cuboctahedron, with eight triangular faces and six square.\n",

Buckminster Fuller, a prolific inventor and philosopher [1].  cummulative( ) delegates to cubocta( ) while accumulating the number in each layer to provide a running total.\n",
