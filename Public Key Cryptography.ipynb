    "# Chapter 5: PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY\n",
    "\n",
    "What we discuss below is a recent breakthrough in cryptography.  When this cryptosystem first appeared in the UK at GCHQ, it was kept secret, because the implications had not been worked out.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However with the emergence of the web and the need for businesses to securely transact as strangers, a public key crytosystem became very appealing. Exchanging secret keys like we used to would not be nearly as convenient. We needed public key crypto to transact business over the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MIT team with initials R, S, A (Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman) managed to keep the USG (the NSA in particular) from clamping down on their patent, since expired.  [The history](https://goo.gl/MGLvXs) is pretty fascinating.  Don't forget to read up on PGP (Pretty Good Privacy).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another PK algorithm is Diffie-Hellman, which has it's own way of letting Bob and Alice exchange information in the clear that will convert to a symmetric secret by some process opaque to Eve.  A modern browser will often offer a contract starting with DH as a public exchange, followed by AES as the symmetric key source of payload.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing to remember is how a public process becomes private through the TLS phase of the relationship, one of handshaking. The client and server agree to enter in on some shared secrets, for the purposes of keeping the transaction private to 3rd parties.  Of course what happens to the encrypted information on either end, i.e. what Alice and/or Bob does with it, is not included in these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The explanation of RSA below is yet another illustration of how \"clock arithmetic\" lets us work with the infinite perumtation of symbols we call plaintext, and yet do invertible things with it, in conjuction with indecipherable keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob's RSA machine knows any incoming encrypted with Bob's public key, is going to need that key's secret twin, not public, to unlock the payload.  Alice never needed Bob's secret, only his public number.  The way that public and private pair were produced in the first place is what makes RSA still secure.  Throwing computer power at a public key, in an attempt to reverse engineer the corresponding private one, is so far proving fruitless, or at least such is the educated opinion of cryptography experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Euler's Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "We're now in a position to test Euler's Theorem, which is going to help us understand an important topic:  public key cryptography.  We want to know what it means and how it's used in RSA, without offering a proof at this juncture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw with our permutation class (which still needs a \\_\\_pow\\_\\_ method by the way) how Bob and Alice might use what's called symmetric key cryptography.  This means Alice needs the same secret key Bob used, to encrypt a message, to decrypt it.  They might use the Advanced Encryption Standard at this point, with any of three lengths of key.\n",
    "\n",
    "AES one a global contest in the 1990s held by NIST, with Rijndeal considered the winner and later renamed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In public key cryptography, Bob and Alice both publish a public number, which in the RSA system is a really large number with only two prime factors, call it Bob_N and Alice_N.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When Bob sends a message to Alice, he uses her public key, Alice_N, to encrypt it and only Alice has a corresponding secret key to get the message back.  Not even Bob can decrypt his own message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by understanding Euler's Theorem, which says:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ a^{\\varphi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\mod n$ where $\\varphi$ is the totient function, and where a and n are relatively prime (co-prime, strangers).\n",
    "\n",
    "That $\\varphi(n)$ refers to the totient function first introduced in the previous chapter.  Euler used the Greek letter phi for it.  It tells us the number of totatives (coprimes) for a given number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets get those two functions side by side, the one for finding totatives, and the other for telling us how many."
