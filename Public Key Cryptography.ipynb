    "# Chapter 5: PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY\n",
    "\n",
    "What we discuss below is a recent breakthrough in cryptography.  When this cryptosystem first appeared in the UK at GCHQ, it was kept secret, because the implications had not been worked out.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However with the emergence of the web and the need for businesses to securely transact as strangers, a public key crytosystem became very appealing. Exchanging secret keys like we used to would not be nearly as convenient. We needed public key crypto to transact business over the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MIT team with initials R, S, A, managed to keep the USG from clamping down on their patent, since expired.  [The history](https://goo.gl/MGLvXs) is pretty fascinating.  Don't forget to read up on PGP (Pretty Good Privacy).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Euler's Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "We're now in a position to test Euler's Theorem, which is going to help us understand an important topic:  public key cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw with our permutation class (which still needs a \\_\\_pow\\_\\_ method by the way) how Bob and Alice might use what's called symmetric key cryptography.  This means Alice needs the same secret key Bob used, to encrypt a message, to decrypt it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In public key cryptography, Bob and Alice both publish a public number, which in the RSA system is a really large number with only two prime factors, call it Bob_N and Alice_N.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When Bob sends a message to Alice, he uses her public key, Alice_N, to encrypt it and only Alice has a corresponding secret key to get the message back.  Not even Bob can decrypt his own message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by understanding Euler's Theorem, which says:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ a^{\\varphi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\mod n$ where $\\varphi$ is the totient function, and where a and n are relatively prime (co-prime, strangers)."

Given Euler's Theorem, one more power beyond the totient power will do the trick.  We need the inverse of c modulo that totient, in other words.  We'd looked at code for that already.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, raising anything to the 1st power is equivalent to the original.  A zeroth power gives the multiplicative identity, typically. A\\*\\*0 == One, whatever One means in that namespace.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Any power equivalent to 1, modulo totient(N), is our goal (thanks to Euler's Theorem), meaning to decrypt c after raising m to e mod N, we need some d such that (c * d) mod totient(N) == 1.  One notch beyond the totient power, going around in our circle, is the original m, where we started the whole process by raising by e. \n",
