    "\n",
    "My impression is some of the Ramanujan convergent series have been verified, which is easier to do through brute force computation, rather than formally proved.  Am I right?\n",

    "$$\\frac{1}{\\pi} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{9801} \\sum^\\infty_{k=0} \\frac{(4k)!(1103+26390k)}{(k!)^4 396^{4k}}$$\n",

    "### The Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a pattern David Koski was discovering, using a calculator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "    from math import atan as arctan\n",
    "    Ø = (1 + rt2(5))/2\n",
    "    arctan( Ø ** 1) -  arctan( Ø ** -1) == arctan(1/2)\n",
    "    arctan( Ø **-1) -  arctan( Ø ** -3) == arctan(1/3)\n",
    "    arctan( Ø **-3) -  arctan( Ø ** -5) == arctan(1/7)\n",
    "    arctan( Ø **-5) -  arctan( Ø ** -7) == arctan(1/18)\n",
    "    arctan( Ø **-7) -  arctan( Ø ** -9) == arctan(1/47)\n",
    "    arctan( Ø **-9) -  arctan( Ø **-11) == arctan(1/123)\n",
    "    . . .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The three dots at the end mean \"and so on\", implying there's some rule. Do you see it?  The exponents of Ø go negative from 1, skipping two, staying odd.  The ```==```, remember, means \"is equal too\".  These are assertions, which gets me thinking of ```unittest```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the conventional picture of what ```arctan``` is doing.  Picture a right triangle on a unit circle and some angle at the origin, defined by the radius (movable) and the bottom edge (fixed).  The angle's measure is the ```arctan``` of opposite to adjacent edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the limitations of floating point numbers, we'll switch to [gmpy2](https://gmpy2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which, unlike the Decimal type, supports arctan.  I've used the Decimal type to verify the Ramanujan monster (above) but it has fewer methods, so lets exit the Standard Library in favor of a 3rd party solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may enlist the `unittest.TestCase` method `assertAlmostEqual` to verify the pattern so far.  We're in control of how many decimal places to check.  I go with 30 in the code cell below.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm organizing my tests to run inside of the `verify` function.  That's slightly unusual, but why not practice?  [Here's a link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#organizing-test-code) to the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm also making use of two versions of ```arctan```, one of which takes two arguments, y, x and computes ```arctan(y, x)```.  Only this latter implementation is strong enough to take us out 30 places, and then over 90 places in the next exercise."
