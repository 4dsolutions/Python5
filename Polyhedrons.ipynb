    "# Chapter 7: POLYHEDRONS\n",
    "\n",
    "The ray-tracing program POV-Ray, free and open source, understands XYZ coordinates, so at the end of the day we'll need those for rendering our polyhedrons as ray tracings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, building our small vocabulary of 26 vertexes will make use of a more congenial set of 4-tuples known as Quadray coordinates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will compute and then store our polyhedron vertexes using Quadray Coordinates (see Chapter 6) and then convert to XYZ on the fly, when it's time to actually write scene description language for POV-Ray to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not confuse Quadrays with Quaternions, the subject of Chapter 11.\n",

    "## Polyhedrons as a Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the Tetrahedron, the simplest of all polyhedrons, also known as a Simplex for that reason.  Its vertexes, labeled 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D' give us a way to represent the faces as a tuple of tuples: (('A', 'B', 'C'), ('A', 'B', 'D'), ('A', 'C', 'D'), ('B', 'C', 'D')).  \n",
    "\n",
    "'A' through 'D' may be considered the names of point vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dual Tetrahedron (-A, -B, -C, -D) intersects our first at its mid-edges and together these define the eight vertexes of a cube.  The cube's dual, an octahedron, has vertexes we might define as vector sums of those already given.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of the cube and octahedron define the twelve diamond faced rhombic dodecahedron, a favorite of Kepler's, and a space-filler.  It's dual, the cuboctahedron, will be the final shape we include.  All 26 vertexes labeled 'A' through 'Z' may be developed as vector sums of the initial A, B, C, D.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Points of Interest](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Povlabels.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before we get to our actual dict of vectors, lets take a look at the Polyhedron that's shaping up, based on the transformations we'll be needing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more complete version will be in the accompanying source code file, polyhedrons.py."
