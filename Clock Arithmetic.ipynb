    "# Chapter 4: CLOCK ARITHMETIC\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling modulo arithmetic \"clock arithmetic\" is a way of calling attention to the finite cyclic nature of always taking remainders, factoring away the \"modulus\".  What does that mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Clock Arithmetic is important to Number Theory, and Number Theory is important to crytography.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyptography, in the not so distant past, would not concern an average civilian, whereas today the HTTPS protocol in every mainstream web browser (Mozilla, Chrome, IE, Safari, Opera...) is capable of implementing what we called TLS, or Transport Layer Security.\n",
    "\n",
    "The web browser client, and server, will handshake, meaning agree on what cryptographic strategy to use: first a public one, to exchange a symmetric key, and then a symmetric one, most likely AES at the time of this writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "AES is the Advanced Encryption Standard, the winner of a global contest as adjudged by NIST.  AES uses \"clock arithemetic\" internally in order to apply several layers of \"mixing it up\" by invertible methods.  Enciphering is reverisble (the whole point) but only if the key is handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, one of our primitive operators is %, for \"modulo\", which relates to the built-in function divmod(&nbsp;).  Lets see how % and divmod do their jobs:"

    "You may find your first years of formal schooling did not emphasize cyclic arithmetic, except in the two most common forms, of telling time and scheduling appointments.  We understand both the 24 hour day, and the 365 day year, comprise a modulus such that we're always talking about our degree of offset into each one.  Adding hours or days, per a timedelta object, keeps us within the scope of some calendar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit circle of 360 degrees, or 2 pi radians, is also treated in a clock-like fashion.  Going around thousands of degrees from some present position, never takes us beyond 360.  We're confined to a finite domain.  Cyclic phenomena more generally are accommodated by our clock arithmetic, of complex numbers, of e to imaginary powers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a kind of \"closure\" in this picture, which might be resonating with you by now, as one of those properties of a group.  Will we find groups in this Chapter?  You bet.  Groups also enjoy the symmetry of a circle in that each member is paired with another \"180 degrees opposite\" although sometimes the inverse might be the same as the self.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we call this \"clock arithmetic\" because even if we say \"20 hours from now\", or \"30 hours ago\" we'll still be somewhere on the circle marked out into 12 intervals, each representing one hour.  The yearly calendar is likewise a kind of modulus.  No matter how many days we add, we're still somewhere between 0 and 365 days into some year.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also call it \"modulo arithmetic\" meaning the computations are always vis-a-vis some fixed modulus.  This word \"modulus\" is our inspiration for the M-numbers coded below.\n",
