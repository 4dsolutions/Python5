    "# Chapter 2: FUNCTIONS AT WORK\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets start off with a Python function, using the keyword def (for \"define\"). Functions help organize code, primarily by doing fixed unchanging things, step by step, to something changing we give it to work on.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we might have a function called \"dress this doll\" that dresses any doll we give it.  The of a function as a verb that typically works on an object, creating a result that, typically is another object.  The mathematical idea of a *function* is not far off.  Mathematical functions never produce different a different result, given the same inputs or arguments.  That's a standard to aim for with the functions you design.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, the function named *cyclic* is what we call a \"callable\" meaning you invoke it by putting parentheses after it.  Not only callables are functions.  When we\n",
    "initialize an instance of a class, coming soon, we'll call the class.  You'll see. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Callable objects in general\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, lets talk right now about how the types, the template classes for lists, dicts, tuples, other data structures, are callables.  Lets list some of those types:  bool (True or False); str (string); list (a collection type); dict (not a sequence); range (yes, a type, not a function) and zip (yes, a type, for creating instances of the zip class).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calling types\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling any type with no arguments logically suggests an empty instance of whatever Something, e.g. d = dict() would be \"empty dictionary\" and the_list = list() should start an empty list. \n",
    "\n",
    "How about int(); float(); decimal()?  These would produce their respective versions of zero, one would think, and they do.\n",
