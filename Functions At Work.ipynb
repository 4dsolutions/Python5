    "# Chapter 2: FUNCTIONS AT WORK\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets start off with a Python function, using the keyword def (for \"define\"). Functions help organize code, primarily by doing fixed unchanging things, step by step, to something changing we give them to work on.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we might have a function called \"dress this doll\" that dresses any doll we give it.  Think of a function as a verb that typically works on an object, creating a result that, typically is another object (what the function returns).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical idea of a *function* is not far off.  Mathematical functions never produce a different result, given the same inputs or arguments.  Different inputs may give the same output, that's fine, but not different outputs given the same inputs.  Functions behave as deterministic machines, not subject to \"environmental factors\" behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a standard to aim for with the functions you design.  Be sparing with global variables that might be passed as arguments instead, lest you confuse your reader.  Global constants (read-only), clearly flagged as such, are less problematic and should be conceived of as additional function inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, the function named *cyclic* is what we call a \"callable\" in Python, meaning you invoke it by putting parentheses after it, with or without arguments.  Not only callables are functions.  Functions are instances of one type of callable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When we initialize an instance of a class, we'll call the class.  Lets take a look at that now. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Callable objects in general\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in types serve as templates for actual lists, dicts, tuples, other data structures. These are callables.  Lets list some of those types:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* bool (True or False) \n",
    "* str (string)\n",
    "* list (a collection type) \n",
    "* tuple (similar to list, but less mutable)\n",
    "* dict (not a sequence, called a mapping) \n",
    "* range (yes, a type, not a function) \n",
    "* zip (yes, also a type, for creating instances of the zip class)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets not forget the other numeric types either, such as float, int and Decimal.  The bool type is actually a subclass of the integers in Python, the True and False serving as keyword names for 1 and 0 respectively:"
