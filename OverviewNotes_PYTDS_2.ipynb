    "Data Science includes Data Management.  This means we might call a DBA (Database Administrator) a kind of data scientist?  Why not?  Their speciality is efficiently warehousing data, meaning the same information is not redundantly scattered.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of rackspace and data center security, of course we want redundancy, but in databases the potential for data corruption increases exponentially with the number of places the same information must be kept up to date.  If a person changes their legal name, you don't want to have to break your primary key, which should be based on something less mutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concepts of mutability versus immutability are important in data science.  In consulting, I would often advertise spreadsheets as ideal for \"what if\" scenarios, but if the goal is to chronicle \"what was\" then the mutability of a spreedsheet becomes a liability.  The bookkeeping community always encourages databases over spreadsheets when it comes to keeping a company or agency's books.\n",
    "\n",
    "DBAs also concern themselves with missing data.  If the data is increasingly full of holes, that's a sign the database may no longer be loved.  DBAs engage in load balancing, meaning they must give priority to services most in demand.  However \"what's in demand\" may be a changing vista."
