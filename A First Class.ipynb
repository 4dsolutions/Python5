    "\n",
    "So you see the matrix type (numpy.matrix) and the permuation type (P) have some similarities. In Group Theory, a branch of mathematics, we talk about the properties of a group, a set of objects and an operation, usually called multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "These properties are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Closure (two elements multiplied always give another element in the set)\n",
    "* Associativity (p * q) * r == p * (q * r)\n",
    "* Inverses (such that p * ~p is the neutral element)\n",
    "* Neutral Element (Identity)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some groups are also Abelian, meaning their operation is also Commutative, not just Associative.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts might seem foreign to learning a computer language such as Python, but Closure should remind you of types, and how two objects of the same type may or may not result in a new object of that type.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example two integers always add to give an integer, but the multiplicative inverse of an integer is not an integer except in the case of 1 itself.  2 * (1/2) equals 1.  1/2 is the inverse of 2.
